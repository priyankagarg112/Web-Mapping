# Web-Mapping

This python module maps the data collected on Volcanoes of USA on world map using the *folium* library. The markers on map are colored based on volcano elevation. The *world.json* file is bascially a geojson file which has data related to whole world like population etc. The population data is mapped on the world map using the *GeoJson* class of folium library.

LayerControl feature is also added to on/off the volcanos layer and population layer.



## Execution steps

1. Keep all files in same folder.
2. *python map.py* (This will create a html file with name *Map1.html* in the same folder. Open it in your browser.)
